# GameHub

GameHub is a video game discovery web app that helps you find new and interesting games to play. With GameHub, you can search for games by platform, genre, and more. 

I build this project with the help of The Ultimate React course by Mosh-Hamedani. You can find the full course [here](https://codewithmosh.com).

> 📝 **Note** <br/>
If the [RAWG API](https://rawg.io/apidocs) is still fetching the data, Ignore this note. If it's not fetching the data anymore, this means that the number of the requests available on the free tier has been exceeded.
